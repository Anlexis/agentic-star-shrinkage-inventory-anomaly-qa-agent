# RET-C2-005 - Outer graph (AgentBaseGraph; Cat 2 two-layer nested architecture)
#
# Shrinkage & Inventory Anomaly Q&A Agent (Cat 2 RAG domain workflow).
#
# Architecture (Cat 2):
#
#   Outer backbone (fixed - identical to Cat 1, do NOT override add_edges()):
#     START -> initialize -> pre_process -> main -> {route} -> post_process -> finalize -> END
#                                             |  (RETRY, max 3)
#                                             -> pre_process
#
#   `main` slot is a GraphNode subclass (ShrinkageQAGraphNode) that delegates
#   the full shrinkage/inventory-anomaly Q&A domain workflow to
#   DomainWorkflowGraph (inner BaseGraph: input_validate -> retrieve ->
#   rerank_filter -> generate_answer -> output_format).
#
#   Domain complexity is fully encapsulated inside the inner graph. The outer
#   backbone is never modified.
#
# Directory layout:
#   src/graph/graph.py                 <- outer graph (this file)
#   src/graph/domain_workflow_graph.py <- inner graph (multi-step topology)
#   src/graph/context_bridge.py        <- input_context hand-off (outer -> inner)
#
# Class-name contract:
#   graph.py class:           ShrinkageInventoryQAAgent (this file)
#   config/agent.yaml class:  "src.graph.graph.ShrinkageInventoryQAAgent"  <- must match
#   src/api/server.py import: from src.graph.graph import ShrinkageInventoryQAAgent
#
# Rules enforced:
#   - ShrinkageInventoryQAAgent inherits AgentBaseGraph (framework base class -
#     direct inheritance)
#   - super().register_nodes() called first (fills initialize + finalize)
#   - ShrinkageQAGraphNode assigned to self._nodes["main"]
#   - _parent_config() forwards only validated runtime settings (never junk)
#   - merge_output() returns only changed keys
#   - add_edges() NOT overridden on the outer graph
#   - No platform-SDK imports (framework/ and shared/ only)
